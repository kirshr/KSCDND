        <h1>Othskala</h1>
        <p>In the world of Othskala, magic, heroes and monster used to be common place.
           During the golden age, heroes arose to battle the forces of evil, be they Drow or Dragon,
           they were always to be found. After centuries of peace, these heroes have been all but forgotten
           beign though as legens or fairy tales, so have the monsters they fought. However, every now and then you can hear
           rumours of creatures doing nasty deeds blah blah blah.</p>
