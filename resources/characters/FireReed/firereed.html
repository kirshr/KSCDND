            <p>Kvothe, a prodigy in the arcane arts. From a young age he was able
              to feel the arcane energies around him, surrounding him like air.
              While heir to his household, Kvothe had no patience or tact for the politics involved.
              Instead, he decided to go to the Arcanum, and learn all he could from the meisters.
              A few years after, he graduated from the Arcanum and returned home, only to find that a huge party was being thrown in his honor.

            <p>You gain a +1 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls made with this Magic Weapon.
              You can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade. The poison remains
              for 1 minute or until an Attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed
              on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become Poisoned for 1 minute.
              The Dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn.</p>
